# Computer Vision Course Projects

This repository contains all the exercises and additional training exercises developed throughout the Computer Vision course. Each week focuses on a different topic, providing reading materials, lectures, exercises, and visual solutions. 
Each week it has been resolved a different quiz for each topic to train for the exam (./Quiz/).
