# Computer Vision Course Projects

This repository contains all the exercises and additional training exercises developed throughout the Computer Vision course. Each week focuses on a different topic, providing reading materials, lectures, exercises, and visual solutions.
For each week it has been resolved a quiz related to the topic of the week [Quiz](./Quiz/).
